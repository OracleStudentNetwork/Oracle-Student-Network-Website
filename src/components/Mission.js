                        Oracle Tutoring was founded by a group of volunteer
                        tutors and instructors passionate about supporting
                        students achieve to their fullest potential during CoVID
                        induced distance learning. We donâ€™t want to think of
                        ourselves as trying to redefine education. We are
                        helping Canadian secondary students participating in
                        distance learning succeed while respecting the
                        boundaries of teachers. We want to change the notion
                        that online tutoring must exclusively consist of
                        pre-booked meetings between a tutor and student.
